# About Ben Kennedy

I am a PhD Candidate in Artificial Intelligence at Capitol Technology University, where I'm pioneering research in cognitive augmentation systems that enhance human decision-making capabilities. My work sits at the fascinating intersection of neuroscience, computer science, and evolutionary psychology, addressing one of the most pressing challenges of our digital age: the mismatch between our ancient brains and modern cognitive demands.

## Professional Journey

### The Intersection of Research and Practice
What sets my approach apart is the unique combination of rigorous academic research with extensive real-world business experience. Over the past decade, I've led complex technology transformations across healthcare, laboratory, and software development environments, consistently delivering projects 22% faster than industry standards while achieving 66% productivity improvements through innovative automation and framework implementations.

This dual perspective—academic researcher and enterprise practitioner—enables me to develop AI solutions that are both theoretically sound and practically viable. My published research, ["Beyond Intelligence: The Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network Using Experts"](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/beyond-intelligence/380428) (IGI Global, 2024), represents this synthesis of scholarly rigor and practical application.

### Academic Foundation
My educational journey reflects a deliberate progression toward understanding and enhancing human cognition:

**Doctor of Philosophy in Artificial Intelligence** - Capitol Technology University (2024-2027)
*Dissertation Focus*: "Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Networks: Bridging Evolutionary Mismatch Through AI-Human Symbiosis"
- Developing novel AI architectures that simulate prefrontal cortex functions
- Investigating human-AI collaboration in high-stakes decision-making environments
- Creating frameworks for cognitive enhancement without replacement of human judgment

**Master of Science in Information Technology Management** - Western Governors University (2020-2021)
- Specialized in IT project management and systems integration
- Advanced study in Agile and Scrum methodologies
- Focus on enterprise-level technology management and digital transformation

**Bachelor of Arts in Psychology** - Belmont Abbey College (2008-2012)
- Foundation in cognitive psychology and human behavior analysis
- Understanding of decision-making processes and cognitive limitations
- Evolutionary psychology principles that inform my current AI research

## Research Philosophy & Approach

### The Cognitive Augmentation Vision
My research is driven by a fundamental belief: AI should enhance rather than replace human cognitive abilities. The human brain, evolved for small-group hunter-gatherer societies, faces systematic challenges when processing the complexity and volume of information in modern environments. Rather than accepting these limitations, I'm developing AI systems that serve as external cognitive assistants—artificial prefrontal cortices that augment our natural decision-making capabilities.

### Core Research Projects

**SCAN (Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network)**: Revolutionary AI architecture that simulates prefrontal cortex functions to enhance human decision-making, problem-solving, and planning capabilities. This system addresses evolutionary mismatch by providing real-time cognitive support in high-stakes environments.

**SCANUE (SCAN User Experience Platform)**: Web-based implementation of cognitive augmentation technology, making advanced AI assistance accessible through intuitive interfaces. Focus on real-time processing, adaptive user experiences, and privacy-first architecture.

**Evolutionary Mismatch Research**: Comprehensive investigation into how modern cognitive demands exceed our brain's evolved capacities, with practical solutions through AI-powered cognitive enhancement.

## Professional Experience & Impact

### Enterprise Leadership
My professional experience spans multiple industries, consistently delivering transformational results:

- **Healthcare Technology**: Subject Matter Expert in EHR/EMR implementations, guiding teams through multi-million dollar vendor projects
- **Government Sector**: Led large-scale intranet modernization for 1000+ end users, achieving 60% increase in utilization through data-driven optimization
- **Digital Innovation**: Independent consultant specializing in AI integration and digital transformation strategies
- **Manufacturing Excellence**: Achieved 55.56% cost reduction in precision tooling through innovative inventory management

### Current Professional Roles
- **PhD Researcher** at Capitol Technology University (2024-Present)
- **IT Project Manager - EDI EMR Implementation** at Highmark Companies (2023-Present)
- **Senior Consultant in Digital Innovation** (2023-Present)
