## Peer-Reviewed Articles

### Published Articles

**Kennedy, B.** et al. (2024). "Beyond Intelligence: The Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network Using Experts." *IGI Global*. 
- **Publisher**: IGI Global
- **URL**: [https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/beyond-intelligence/380428](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/beyond-intelligence/380428)
- **Abstract**: This chapter presents the development of SCAN (Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network) and SCANUE, innovative AI systems designed to simulate prefrontal cortex functions and enhance human decision-making, problem-solving, and planning capabilities. The research addresses evolutionary mismatch challenges where modern cognitive demands exceed the brain's evolved capacities.
- **Keywords**: Cognitive Augmentation, Artificial Intelligence, Prefrontal Cortex Simulation, Human-AI Collaboration, Evolutionary Mismatch
- **Impact**: Groundbreaking research in cognitive enhancement technology with applications in high-stakes decision-making environments
- **Status**: **Published** - Available via IGI Global
