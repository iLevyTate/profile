**Abstract**: This chapter presents the comprehensive development of SCAN (Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network) and SCANUE, innovative AI systems designed to simulate prefrontal cortex functions and enhance human decision-making, problem-solving, and planning capabilities. The research addresses critical evolutionary mismatch challenges where modern cognitive demands systematically exceed the brain's evolved capacities. Through rigorous interdisciplinary methodology combining cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and computer science, we demonstrate practical frameworks for cognitive enhancement that maintain human agency while significantly improving decision quality in high-stakes environments.
