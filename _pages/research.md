# Research Portfolio

My research advances the field of artificial intelligence by developing cognitive augmentation systems that enhance human decision-making capabilities, addressing critical challenges at the intersection of neuroscience, computer science, and evolutionary psychology.

## Doctoral Research Program

### PhD in Artificial Intelligence - Capitol Technology University (2024-2027)
**Dissertation Focus**: "Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Networks: Bridging Evolutionary Mismatch Through AI-Human Symbiosis"

**Research Advisor**: Capitol Technology University AI Research Faculty
**Expected Completion**: November 2027

## Primary Research Projects

### SCAN (Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network)
**Objective**: Develop AI architectures that simulate prefrontal cortex functions to augment human cognitive abilities in complex, high-stakes environments.

**Research Questions**:
- How can AI systems effectively simulate prefrontal cortex functions for enhanced decision-making?
- What are the optimal architectures for real-time cognitive support in dynamic environments?
- How do we ensure seamless human-AI collaboration while maintaining human agency?

**Methodology**: 
- Neural network development combining transformer architectures with cognitive modeling
- Real-time processing optimization for web-based AI systems
- Human-computer interaction design principles
- Longitudinal user studies in business and healthcare environments

**Key Innovations**:
- First comprehensive framework for prefrontal cortex simulation in AI systems
- Novel approach to evolutionary mismatch solutions through cognitive enhancement
- Integration of cognitive psychology principles with modern AI architectures

**Applications**: Healthcare diagnostics, business intelligence, strategic planning, educational enhancement

### SCANUE (SCAN User Experience Platform)
**Objective**: Create accessible, web-based cognitive augmentation tools that provide real-time, user-specific cognitive support through intuitive interfaces.

**Technical Innovation**:
- Web-based delivery of AI-powered cognitive enhancement with sub-second response times
- Adaptive user interfaces that learn from individual cognitive patterns
- Scalable deployment strategies for enterprise environments
- Privacy-first architecture ensuring data security and user control

**Research Contributions**:
- Development of intuitive cognitive augmentation interfaces
- Real-time processing optimization for distributed AI systems
- User experience design methodologies for human-AI collaboration
- Empirical studies on cognitive load reduction in complex tasks

### Evolutionary Mismatch Research
**Research Focus**: Investigating how modern cognitive demands exceed the brain's evolved capacities and developing AI solutions to bridge this evolutionary gap.

**Core Hypothesis**: The human brain, evolved for small-group hunter-gatherer societies, faces systematic challenges in processing the complexity and volume of information in modern environments. AI-powered cognitive augmentation can serve as an external prefrontal cortex, enhancing human decision-making without replacing human judgment.

**Methodology**:
- Cognitive psychology research combined with AI system development
- Comparative analysis of decision-making performance across different cognitive augmentation approaches
- Longitudinal studies measuring cognitive load reduction and decision quality improvement
