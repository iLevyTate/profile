# Research

PhD research at Capitol Technology University focusing on cognitive augmentation systems and human-AI collaboration.

## Current Projects

### SCAN (Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network)
AI systems that simulate prefrontal cortex functions to enhance human decision-making, problem-solving, and planning.

### SCANUE (SCAN User Experience)
Web-based cognitive augmentation platform providing real-time, user-specific cognitive support.

### Evolutionary Mismatch Research
Examining how modern cognitive demands exceed brain's evolved capacities and developing AI solutions.
