# Ben Kennedy
**PhD Candidate in Artificial Intelligence | Published AI Researcher | Enterprise Project Management Expert**

I bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and practical business transformation, specializing in cognitive augmentation systems that enhance human decision-making capabilities. Currently pursuing my PhD at Capitol Technology University while maintaining a proven track record of delivering complex technology projects 22% faster than industry standards.

## Research Excellence

### Cognitive Augmentation Pioneer
My doctoral research centers on developing **SCAN (Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network)** and **SCANUE** systems—revolutionary AI architectures that simulate prefrontal cortex functions to augment human cognitive abilities. This work addresses a critical challenge in our digital age: the evolutionary mismatch between our brain's ancient design and modern cognitive demands.

**Published Research**: ["Beyond Intelligence: The Synthetic Cognitive Augmentation Network Using Experts"](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/beyond-intelligence/380428) (IGI Global, 2024) — A groundbreaking exploration of human-AI symbiosis in high-stakes decision-making environments.

### Research Impact
- **Novel Architecture**: First comprehensive framework for prefrontal cortex simulation in AI systems
- **Real-world Applications**: Healthcare diagnostics, business intelligence, strategic planning
- **Academic Contribution**: Contributing to the emerging field of cognitive enhancement technology

## Professional Leadership

### Enterprise Project Management
Over a decade of experience transforming complex healthcare and technology organizations through strategic project management:

- **Performance Excellence**: Consistently deliver projects 22% faster than industry benchmarks
- **Productivity Innovation**: Achieved 66% productivity improvements through automation and framework implementation
- **Scale Impact**: Led modernization initiatives serving 1000+ end users across healthcare and government sectors
- **Technology Expertise**: Subject Matter Expert in EHR/EMR implementations, Agile/Scrum methodologies

### Current Roles
- **PhD Researcher** at Capitol Technology University (2024-2027)
- **IT Project Manager** at Highmark Companies (2023-Present)
- **Independent Consultant** in Digital Innovation (2023-Present)

## Innovation Portfolio
