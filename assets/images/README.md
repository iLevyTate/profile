## Image Guidelines

1. **Format**: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency
2. **Quality**: High resolution, professionally captured/designed
3. **Style**: Consistent with academic/professional theme
4. **Colors**: Should work well with the contrast theme (dark blues, gradients)
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure adequate contrast and avoid text in images

## Optimization

All images should be optimized for web:
- Compress to appropriate file size without losing quality
- Use appropriate dimensions (don't scale down large images in HTML)
- Consider WebP format for better compression (with fallbacks)

## Placeholder Status

Currently, all image references in the code are placeholders. The site will function without these images, but the visual impact will be significantly enhanced with proper professional imagery.

To implement:
1. Create/source appropriate images following the guidelines above
2. Save them in this directory with the exact filenames listed
3. Ensure they meet the dimension and quality requirements
4. Test the site to verify proper loading and visual appeal

## Attribution

If using stock photos or licensed images, ensure proper attribution is provided in the site footer or a separate credits page as required by the license terms.
